# 08APR25 Linear Mixed Model (LMM)
# This code has been written to conduct LMMs of the various categories judging
# how similiar strains are based on: genic or intergenic regions that have SNPs, share coding genes that have SNPs,
# share teh same areas of the genome that have CNV, share the same coding genes that have CNV, share the same exact mutation ID
# (so identical SNPs), share identcial SNPs in coding genes, share mutated non-synonomous coding genes
# all categories have been filtered to not include changes that occur in the ancestor
# The parameters of the LMM include the effect of being in different school, having different background and being in different pairs

# Summary of steps
# 1) Load necessary libraries
# 2) Make an appropriate dataset for further analysis
# 3) Make distance matrices of the parameters of the LMM
# 4) Make distance matrices for the response variables
# 5) Conduct the LMM

# 1) Load necessary libraries
